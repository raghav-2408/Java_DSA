# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for Java data structures and algorithms. It includes implementation examples and syntax for various data structures commonly used in computer science and competitive programming.

## Contents

1. **Arrays**
   - Declaration, initialization, and basic operations.

2. **Linked Lists**
   - Single linked list operations and circular linked list insertion.

3. **Stacks**
   - Basic stack operations using Java's `Stack` class.

4. **Queues**
   - Queue operations using Java's `Queue` interface.

5. **Trees**
   - Binary tree creation and tree traversal operations (preorder, inorder, postorder).

6. **Hash Map**
   - Basic usage of Java's `HashMap` for key-value storage.

7. **Hash Set**
   - Basic usage of Java's `HashSet` for storing unique elements.

8. **Priority Queue**
   - Basic usage of Java's `PriorityQueue` for managing priority-based elements.

9. **Doubly Linked List**
   - Implementation and basic operations.

10. **Additional Operations**
    - Single linked list insertion at the end and deletion by value.
    - Circular linked list insertion.
    - Tree traversal operations (preorder, inorder, postorder).
    - Stack and queue operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue).
    - Append operation in linked lists.
